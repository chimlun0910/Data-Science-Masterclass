    "- REST provides a lighter-weight alternative. Many developers found SOAP cumbersome and hard to use. Instead of using XML to make a request, REST (usually) relies on a simple URL. In some situations you must provide additional information, but most web services using REST rely exclusively on using the URL approach. REST can use four different HTTP 1.1 verbs (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to perform tasks. REST stands for Representational State Transfer.\n",

The main idea behind designing SOAP was to ensure that programs built on different platforms and programming languages could exchange data in an easy manner. SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol and supports the XML data format only and strongly follows preset standards such as messaging structure, a set of encoding rules, and a convention for providing procedure requests and responses.\n",
